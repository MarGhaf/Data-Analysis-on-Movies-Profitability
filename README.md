    . Qestion 2: Best relase month for geners and gross?
    
    . Qestion 3 : What is the perfect running time for a movie?


## Data Understanding and Analysis

The general research strategy in this project is to do exploratory data analysis on the persent data collection in film industry. The process include belwo steps:

 . Import libraries and load dataset
 
 . Data cleaning
 
 . Asking Analytical Questions and Visualizations
 
 . Conclusion & Recommendations
 
 
### Import libraries and load dataset

The first step to start a project is to choose neaded libraries and modulas in python and import them to your framework. For this project belwo libries were used:

Pandas: a software library written for the Python programming language used for data analysis and associated manipulation of tabular data in Dataframes
Numpy:  the core library for scientific computing in Python
Matplotlib: a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
Seaborn: a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. 
OS: a module in Python provides functions for creating and removing a directory (folder), fetching its contents, changing and identifying the current directory.
Warnings :  a module suppresses repeated warnings from the same source to cut down on the annoyance of seeing the same message over and over.

There are 6 movie database in this project: 

1. bom.movie_gross.csv.gz

2. tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz

3. tmdb.movies.csv.gz

4. rt.movie_info.tsv.gz

5. rt.reviews.tsv.gz

6. im.db

These data collected from various locations, the different files have different formats. Some are compressed CSV (comma-separated values) can be opened using  pd.read_csv () method, while the data from IMDB is located in a SQLite database and can asscess them with pd.read_sql() method.
